# NodeJS - Midterm Project

- Keep the database in-memory and inside a *Model* (No external database)
- The site must have login and signup function
- Use *bcrypt* to hash and verify the password [https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt]
- Use cookies to keep user information in the browser after they login. Clear the cookies when they log out
